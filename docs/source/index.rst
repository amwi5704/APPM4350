Welcome to conformalMaps documentation!
==============================================

This package conformalMaps is about conformal mappings and their applications. It was made to be as interactive as possible with sliders from IPyWidgets.
The aim is to create a full package of scientific Python with release, documentation, webpage etc... The package adresses students of applied sciences, lecturers, researchers and engineers and scientists at companies.

- Application examples can be found on `Conformal Mappings with SymPy <https://github.com/zolabar/ConformalMappingSympy>`_  
- Back to `Conformal-Maps github repository <https://github.com/im-AMS/Conformal-Maps>`_ 

The following figure illustrates the GUI for the deformation of a rectangular geometry.
