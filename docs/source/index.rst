Welcome to conformalMaps documentation!
==============================================

This package conformalMaps is about conformal mappings and their applications. It was made to be as interactive as possible with sliders from IPyWidgets.
The aim is to create a full package of scientific Python with release, documentation, webpage etc... The package adresses students of applied sciences, lecturers, researchers and engineers and scientists at companies.

Application examples can be found on `Conformal Mappings with SymPy <https://github.com/zolabar/ConformalMappingSympy>`_ . Back to `Conformal-Mapps github repository <https://github.com/zolabar/Conformal-Maps>`_ .
